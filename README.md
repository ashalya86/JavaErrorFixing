This repository is dedicated to addressing and providing sollutions for PMD Source Code Analyser 
violations in our codebase. PMD helps us identify potential issues, code style violations, and anti-patterns, 
allowing us to maintain high code quality and readability.

## About PMD
PMD is a source code analyzer that detects common programming flaws, 
such as unused variables, empty catch blocks, and inefficient code constructs. 
By running PMD on our codebase, we can ensure adherence to best practices and improve overall code health.
 PMD categorizes violations into nine types, including Index, Best Practices, Code Style, Design, Documentation,
 Error Prone, Multithreading, Performance, and Security.

## Our Work
As a first step this project gives fixes for Java violations under the performance category. PMD identifies 24 violations </br>
under categoery performance [a link](https://docs.pmd-code.org/latest/pmd_rules_java_performance.html)
. We provide fixes for a selected 10 violations.
