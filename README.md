This repository is dedicated to addressing PMD Source Code Analyser violations in our codebase. 
PMD helps us identify potential issues, code style violations, and anti-patterns, 
allowing us to maintain high code quality and readability.

##About PMD
PMD is a source code analyzer that detects common programming flaws, 
such as unused variables, empty catch blocks, and inefficient code constructs. 
By running PMD on our codebase, we can ensure adherence to best practices and improve overall code health.

##To run:
javac Main.java
java Main "input file path" "output file path"
